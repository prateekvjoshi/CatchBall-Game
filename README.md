Catch The Bouncing Ball
==============

A simple game built using Python where you catch a bouncing ball on the window. This game utilizes Pygame. Before you proceed further, make sure you install it. Installation instructions for various platforms are given here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml. If you are using Macports, then the following command will install it for you:

	sudo port install py-game
	
Pygame still uses an older version of Python (2.4 to be exact). So when you run the code, you need to run the following command to make it work:

	python2.4 catchBall.py
